"""Assert the execution worker is not handed application secrets.

The worker runs user-authored scripts with no sandbox (see SECURITY.md), so it is
the container most likely to be compromised. If it can read SERVER_JWT_SECRET out
of its environment, an attacker can forge a session token for any user; the
Mailgun key would let them send mail as us.

This reads the *rendered* compose config on stdin, so it checks what Docker will
actually run rather than what the YAML appears to say:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config | python3 scripts/check-worker-env.py

Exits non-zero with an explanation on failure. Run by CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
