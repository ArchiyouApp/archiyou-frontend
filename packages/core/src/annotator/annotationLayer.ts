 *
 *  Why it lives in core: annotations ARE core (the Annotator). meshup is a standalone package
 *  that must never import core, so it only keeps the two-sided link intact and calls the
 *  annotation's own toSVG()/toShape() structurally. brep is core's own kernel and imports
 *  this directly. Between them they used to hold two copies of this logic, which is how brep
 *  came to draw every dimension twice while meshup deduped.
