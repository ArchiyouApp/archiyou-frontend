# The image ships no code — the monorepo checkout is bind-mounted at /archiyou
# (see apps/server/Dockerfile), so node_modules comes from the mount too.
#
# Boot sequence:
#   1. verify the mount is actually there (otherwise every later error is opaque)
#   2. install dependencies if they are missing or stale
#   3. build the workspace (editor SPA, packages, script modules) if it is stale
#   4. exec the real command (pnpm start / pnpm worker)
#
# Step 3 is why a deploy is just `git pull && docker compose restart api`: the
# editor's dist/ is NOT committed, and `docker compose build` only rebuilds this
# codeless base image. Note that the API does not answer until the build
# finishes — a cold build of the editor is minutes, not seconds.

# ─── 3. build ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# What gets built, in this order:
#   packages/meshup  → dist/. Its package `exports` point at dist, not src, so
#                      the editor build cannot resolve @archiyou/meshup until
#                      this has run. Must come first.
#   apps/editor      → dist/, bind-mounted into caddy as /srv/app. Not in git.
#   modules/*, */*   → dist/bundle.js, read in place by ModuleHost. A no-op that
#                      exits 0 when the overlay is absent, as in a public
#                      checkout. NOTE these live in a separate, gitignored
#                      repository, so a root `git pull` does NOT update them —
#                      pull that checkout too.
#
# Not built, deliberately:
#   apps/server      — no build script; runs from source via tsx.
#   packages/core, ui, types, module-sdk — their `exports` point at src/, so
#                      consumers compile the sources. core HAS a build script,
#                      but nothing imports its dist.
#
# This is an explicit list rather than the root `pnpm build`, because `turbo
# build` currently refuses to run at all: @archiyou/editor and @archiyou/ui
# depend on each other, and turbo rejects the cyclic task graph. Fix that cycle
# and this collapses back to one `pnpm --dir "$REPO" run build`.
#
# Escape hatches:  ARCHIYOU_SKIP_BUILD=1 never builds (boot on whatever was built
# last, when a build breaks on the server); ARCHIYOU_FORCE_BUILD=1 always builds.
# The latter is how you pick up a changed SERVER_API_BASE_URL — that lives in the
# environment, not in a source file, so the staleness check cannot see it.

# Both ways of disabling the build SAY SO. A silent skip is indistinguishable
# from a build that decided it was up to date, and sends you hunting through the
# staleness check for a reason that was never there.

    # `env -i`: the build runs with an explicitly constructed environment, NOT
    # this container's. Two independent reasons, both load-bearing:
    #
    #  1. SECRETS. apps/editor/vite.config.ts sets envPrefix ['VITE_','SERVER_'],
    #     and this container is started with `env_file: .env` — so every
    #     SERVER_* variable, SERVER_JWT_SECRET included, is visible to Vite and

    #     the only safe way round that; a denylist would leak the next secret
    #     someone adds to .env.
    #  2. SERVER_API_BASE_URL must be /api (caddy strips that prefix before
    #     proxying, see Caddyfile). Vite reads it from the environment at BUILD
    #     time and inlines it, so it cannot be changed without rebuilding.
