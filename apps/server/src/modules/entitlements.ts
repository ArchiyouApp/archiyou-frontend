 * Stored literally in `users.modules` as the single entry `["*"]`. It can never
 * collide with a real module id: ModuleRegistry restricts ids and globals to
 * `/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/`, so `*` is unreachable as a name.
 *
 * Intended for staff and for the operator's own account. It is not a substitute
 * for per-module grants on customer accounts, because it silently widens every
 * time a module is deployed.
