/**
 *  toMeshup.ts — the one seam between the two kernels.
 *
 *  brep geometry is exact (NURBS surfaces, analytic curves); meshup geometry is discrete.
 *  Every Archiyou output — GLB, SVG, DXF, STL, DAE — is produced by the meshup-side exporters
 *  walking a SceneNode graph. Rather than duplicate all of that for OpenCascade, a brep Shape
 *  is tessellated once (it already knows how: Shape.toMeshShape) and rebuilt as the equivalent
 *  meshup Shape. From there the existing pipeline runs unchanged, so brep runs get the same
 *  GLB extras, materials, edge-visibility extensions, scene paths and animations for free.
 *
 *  What is lost: exact surfaces. A brep cylinder exports as its triangulation, at whatever
 *  MESHING_* quality was requested — the same fidelity the old viewer path had, since it also
 *  fed on toMeshShape(). What is kept: the shape's own edges, exported as Curves rather than
 *  being re-derived from mesh topology, so a brep model still draws its true silhouette.
