/**
 *  Where the two kernels DISAGREE today — the inventory shape-parity.test.ts routes around.
 *
 *  Every test here asserts the CURRENT behaviour of both kernels and says, in its comment, what
 *  the behaviour ought to be. That makes each one a tripwire pointing the right way: the day a
 *  divergence is fixed, its test fails, and the fix is to delete the test (and the workaround in
 *  shape-parity.test.ts that quotes it). Nothing here is an endorsement.
 *
 *  These were all found by building the same shape on both kernels and measuring after every
 *  operation — see shape-parity.test.ts for the harness.
 *
 *  Roughly in order of how much damage each one does to a script that switches kernel:
 *
 *    1  arc(start, mid, end) draws a different curve on each kernel
 *    2  union()/intersection() mutate on mesh but not on brep
 *    3  rotate*() defaults to a different pivot for linear shapes
 *    4  brep scale() leaves a linear shape untyped, breaking the next call on it
 *    5  brep extend() ignores the transform the edge has picked up
 *    6  brep subtract() throws when the cut severs the solid
 *    7  brep Solid.center() is the surface centroid, not the centre of mass
 *    8  extruding a closed outline gives a capped solid on mesh, an open shell on brep
 *    9  mirror() takes its two arguments in the opposite order
 *   10  area()/size()/length() answer for different shape families
 *   11  closed outlines are seamed differently, so start()/end()/middle() differ
 *   12  brep pointAt() is parameter-based where mesh pointAtPerc() is arc-length-based
 *   13  is2D() uses an exact zero test on mesh and a tolerant one on brep
 *   14  Polygon.center() double-counts the closing vertex on mesh
 *   15  odds and ends: intersect(), distanceTo(), fillet()/chamfer(), circle spans
