/**
 * types.ts — the contract between Archiyou and a script module.
 *
 * A script module adds one global to the scope a user script runs in (see
 * packages/core/src/runner/Runner.ts). Modules are distributed separately from
 * this repository and may be separately licensed, so this file is the ONLY
 * coupling point between the two: a module compiles against these types and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free — importing anything from @archiyou/core here
 * would make every module repo depend on the whole engine to typecheck. Where a
 * real core type is wanted, it is modelled structurally (see AyArchiyou) so
 * core's own types stay assignable to it.
 *
 * This file is AUTHORED HERE and MIRRORED into the engine as
 * packages/core/src/modules/sdkTypes.ts, a generated verbatim copy. Core is
 * published to npm and this package is not, so core cannot import it by name
 * without shipping an unresolvable import. After editing this file run
 * `pnpm --filter @archiyou/core sync:sdk-types`; a unit test there fails while
 * the copy is stale.
